## Vue 3 + Vite SellersFunding Boilerplate

This boilerplate is using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/). For styles we're using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and our own [Design System](https://vuetemplate.z13.web.core.windows.net/).

### Quick start:

Download or clone the project and:
- Install recommended extensions on your VSCode.
- Install dependencies: `yarn install`
- Install recommended extensions on your VSCode.
- To integrate you'll need to create a .env file just like .env.dev example and add your API key and URL.
- And then: `yarn dev`
- To develop using the reverse proxy you'll need to configure a new route on appsettings.json RouteConfig and run on this project the yellowstone script: `yarn yellowstone`
